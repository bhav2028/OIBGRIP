                        the Persian exchanges with the Middle East and the British colonial system have all contributed immensely 
                        towards laying the foundation of the Indian cuisine. India is a big country with many states and regions. 
                        Each region   offers a unique assortment of dishes and cooking techniques. Each regional cuisine uses its 
                        own locally grown herbs, spices, fruits and vegetables. These regional cuisines collectively combined

                        And no Indian dish is complete without spices. Indian food is a combination of all six tastes like sweet, 
                        sour, salty, bitter, spicy and astringent. </p><br><br>
